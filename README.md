## IMPORTANT
In order to load the datasets, you can follow 2 alternatives:

### OPTION 1 (Quick Load): Loading Dataset from JSON previously constructed

1. You will need to run only one [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/leoipn/Project_2/tree/main/Load) located in the Fast Load Folder that will get the datasets from the JSON files previously cleaned and ready to load them to Mongo:

### OPTION 2: Loading Dataset by API Calls (Building the data set)

For loading both notebooks and their databases you will need a Token generated by Spotify Dev in order to do the API calls to build both data sets

1. First you must run the following [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/leoipn/Project_2/blob/main/ETL/LoadingFiles.ipynb) located in ETL Folder

    ETL > LoadingFiles.ipynb 
    token generated in: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-track/

 2. Then you must run a second [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/leoipn/Project_2/blob/main/ETL/Spotify%20Music%20Analysis.ipynb) to get the Music Features data set

    Top Songs Popularity > Jupyter Notebook > Spotify Music Analysis.ipynb
    token generated in : # https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-audio-features-several-tracks/

## Purpose

Desing and deploy a visualization interface that helps understand a story behind our data. We want to provide information to any artist that helps him understand how are they performing and who is the person or the group of people who listen them the most. All visuals presented in the dashboard refered to the number of streams by artist, song or country, this streams count only referer to the streams that a song had by day while the song was in the Top 200 most streamed songs. So we understand that the streams showed, can be a fraction of the total streams a song actyally has. 

Important consideration during this project is that during the definition of what we wanted to visualize in the final product, we always considered the experience the user can have while he/she manipulates and utilize diferent filters and option to find what he/she is looking for. Creating a clean, ordered, and with the purpose of explain what kind of music and from who is listened all aroung the world.

We wanted to explore universal artists, genders, popularity and music listened around the world on one of the most important platform for online streaming.
Everyone know how music sounds and we love it, but what about how it is seen?

## Coding Approach

The approach to this project followed a straight road, find the data sources, process the data collected through ETL process
  1. Extracting the dataset from csv extracted from Spotify Charts
  2. Cleaning and ordering with Python (Pandas)
  3. Loading the final datasets to Mongo (Python Pymongo)

The visualization was constructed in HTML and CSS, JS was used to feed all the data already filtered and clean from a Flask app that funcitoned as a local server.

## Data Munging

We can defined the following steps as a more detail explanation of the Data Munging:

    1. Web Scraping to Spotify Charts to get Top 200.
    2. Web API request to retrieve Genre by Artist.
    3. Pandas library to clean N/As, format Dates and merge datasets
    4. PyMongo that connected with a MongoDB to store the final dataset
    5. Flask App that retrieves the data from Mongo and applies the summarization and filtering.
    6. Javascript that calls the endpoints to get the data for visualization (Chart JS and D3).
    7. HTML and CSS that present the charts, visuals and dropdown filters.
    8. Bootstrap that provides a Dashboard template.

## Exploring Music

We can explore music through different features like it´s acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness and tempo among others.
We can use this audio features provided by Spotify API´s for different purposes. For example to determine people's choice or to create predictions for dynamic playlists recommendations or even for target publicity.
