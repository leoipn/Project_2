## Description:

These days everyone has a relative or a close friend who has been diagnosed with diabetes. We can see that is getting more frequent every day. In this matter we decided to Analyze Diabetes Disease Diagnosed for US Population.

As a team we define that Our Project main objective is to discover the incidents of social demographics in diagnosed diabetes for population in US. We will analyze the relationship between gender, race-ethnicity, ages and educational levels through the years, as the data admits.

We approach our project in a way to be able to answer the following Questions:

What is the proportion by ethnicity with diagnosed diabetes?

How is the disease behavior in range of ages to define if there is a correlation between them?

What´s the gender distribution for diagnosed diabetes?

How are the impacts in the educational and income levels in relationship with diagnosed diabetes?

In order to answer these previous questions, we found that the best place to find our data Based on population in the US is the CDC, Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
