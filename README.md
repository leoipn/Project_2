## Proposal:

Since the origin of modern times humanity has been soroundedby music, we may say that history can be tell throuhg music.

During time, muscic has been constantly changing, evolving or derivating in several genders. The music taste during time has been changing. New artists have been emerging. 
We would like to study these changes through Data Analytics.

As a team we are always close to music. Music is an universal language, like programming languages it has been the union of many cultures and traditions.
We would like to explore artists, genders, popularity and music itself
